# DependencyLookup
Small tool to find the dependency of a PlayServices or Support library. Please visit the [Dependency Lookup][1] homepage to try this service.

## Technical deails

The master branch contains just the small java programm which generated the CSV files for the web tool. The website itself is hosted in the [gh-pages branch][2].  
The planâ„¢ is to keep the data up to date with a travis-ci cronjob. So there should be no manual actions required to have an up-to-date webtool.

## Sick of typing? Use voice assistants!

Just say *"Ask dependency lookup where is the class Ad View"*.

You can also use this at your Android 6.0+ phones, iOS 9.0+ phones and Google Home. See also [my action homepage][3]. A german translation will follow.  
You have an Alexa? It also runs there. Check my [German][4], [British English][5] or [American English][6] skill.
