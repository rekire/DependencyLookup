# DependencyLookup
Small tool to find the dependency of a PlayServices or Support library. Please visit the [Dependency Lookup][1] homepage to try this service.

##Technical deails

The master branch contains just the small java programm which generated the CSV files for the web tool. The website itself is hosted in the [gh-pages branch][2].  
The plan&tm; is to keep the data up to date with a travis-ci cronjob. So there should be no more actions required for me.
